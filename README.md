# helping you manage your <img class="imgur" src="images/imgur-logo.png" /> album images

I have been working with Imgur images and the Imgur API for several years now, and I really
appreciate the service. No frills, no ads for third-party api usage, unlimited storage and
high res, high availability, images for end users. I love that it exists!

I do have to say, thought,
<i>the interface for managing images on Imgur is very lacking</i>. For my albums that have
upwards of 1000+ images, it is super untenable to have to go into the album folder and view
every single image while trying to edit the description of a single image. It's very laggy
and buggy when scaling to include all images on that one page and there's no pagination
whatsoever.

So, I built this tool, iManagur, mostly to provide a paginated way to edit your image
descriptions and titles, with a search. Boom, that's it.

Please consider donating to the success of this project and I thank you all for your
support. It helps motivate me to continue to make things for anyone and everyone to use.
